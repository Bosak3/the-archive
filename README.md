# README

This application uses React as the frontend development language, and Ruby on Rails as the backend API.

Using a custom Rails API for the data included in my application. I also used custom CSS for the styling of my application.

Users will be able to browser through movies, books and video games fetched from the Rails API backend. Utilizing client-side routing to create a seamless one-page application experience.

Current CRUD actions include the ability for a user to post a review for individual movies, books or games.
